Turtl bookmarker extension
=======================

The bookmarker provides an easy-to-use interface to bookmark websites
via Turtl. It requires the Turtl desktop app to be running, which it talks to
via the desktop's [HTTP server](https://turtlapp.com/docs/clients/desktop/index#http-server)
to send it info about the current page.

Please see the [extension documentation](https://turtlapp.com/docs/clients/extensions/index).
